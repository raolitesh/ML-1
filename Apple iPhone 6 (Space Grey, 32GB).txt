    First of all, THANK YOU AMAZON India.My first phone, from online store.It was a big step for me, after hearing online stores are some time fraud also...But i really trust amazon India.Even they proved it.I got my iPhone 6 in 1 day delivery as they promised.When i opened the box, the feeling was speechless...The phone was fully covered with glass paper as brand new. Every thing was in the box. (Ear phone, power adapter, lightning cable, sim ejector, and the user guide)After registration, 1st i checked my warranty. It is correct.Also i checked every accessories, it's all was perfect as brand new.I am reviewing my phone after 2 month of buying.Today also i did not get any issues.Accept heating issue, I noticed that when i playing heavy game, video editing,  it realises some heat. May be the reason is for its aluminium body, cause aluminium is one of the best thermal conductor.Battery backup is also good, with normal use it gives you full day backup. For heavy use it will give you 4 to 5 hours.From zero to full charge it will take 50 minutes.Sound quality is really very good. Louder also.And the main thing is camera, even 1.3 MP front facing camera also gives you very good clicks. And the back is crystal clear with 8 MP.For my opinion, under 25k iPhone 6 32 GB is best budget phone.And there is nothing to worry about the phone, after all there service centre is also gives you hassle free service.You can make a insurance for more safety, if you want.Once again Thank You AMAZON India.

    Hello Guys,First time while shopping on amazon, i was apprehensive in buying this phone. As, apple has not officially launched 32gb version of iPhone 6. And thanks to few youtube videos which show that in china, its very easy to swap the memory module and repack the phone as NEW.But I did a little bit of research on this model.1. This phone has been launched in China & Taiwan in Gold version .2. In April, the phone will be launched in Few European countries as well.Verdit: The phone is Genuine. It registered in Apple's website and shows 12 months warranty.( I have attached pics of the box for reference, serial numbers have been hidden for privacy & security)The phone is arrived in a day of order. Amazon does a great JOB in delivery. Thumbs up for that.iOS 10 is installed on the phone. Unlike 16gb version, where iOS 9 is installed.I was hoping iOS9, as iOS10 does reduces the performance of the phone.My Usage for the phone is Camera and storage. I wont be running many apps on the phone. This is actually a second phone meant or entertainment. Thus iOS 10 will not be performance issue here.Iphone 6 is a great phone, it had only one flaw, that the cheapest model was 16GB variant. Today in keeping few apps, photos and music, 16gb memory is exhausted. But the 32GB version solves this problem.Iphone 6 cannot be matched in the following aspects:1. Looks: Slim profile with less weight2. Camera: 8MP does a great job than many 12MP budget phones3. Music : Apple music is amazing4.  Apps: Apps for iPhone are designed better than Android devices.5. Overall feel of owing an iPhone is amazing.I would recommend this phone to people who have limited use like, email, music & camera. For them this phone is the best buy.If you can take apple care protection plan of Rs 4500, your warranty will be extended for another year. Even after using the phone for 2 years, your resale value of the phone will be at least Rs. 10,000.If you are looking to get in the Apple ecosystem and have light usage, then don't think twice. - Just go for it.If you like my review, please hit the LIKE button. If you have any question, shoot a message, will reply to it asap.

    I have purchased iphone 2 months back. This is my first apple product and I was very much confused before buying this phone. I have seen a lot of negative reviews about this product and some have got defective piece, fake products, refurbished phone etc. I have read lots of reviews and comparisons before purchasing, since I'm investing more than 25k for this phone. I was using android phones earlier, Samsung Htc etc, so I was not sure whether to go for iPhone or not.But after 2 months of usage, I feels I have made right choice. The delivery was fast and before expected date, also the product I received is completely genuine and in perfect condition, thanks to amazon. I have confirmed the warranty with apple website. 1 gb RAM in iPhone is far better than 3-4 gb android ph available in market. The camera is very good and it is up to my expectations. There is not heating problems and also the phone never hangs even with lots of background applications. Only problem is with the battery life, it discharges very fast and if you are using the phone continuously (movies, youtube, games etc) it will last for only 3 hrs max. But the best part is that when the phone is idle there is no discharge. Even with 20 % battery the phone won't get switched off for 3-4 hrs.Pros: the brand value of iPhoneBeautiful, slim and unique designGood camera and displayCons: battery drains out very fastScreen is not gorilla glass, you will be in trouble if u dropped phSingle sim and no option for external memory card and expandable memoryLimited free applications in Apple StoreDisplay is not full HDPrice is very high comparing to features and specifications .Overall experience is very good till now and iPhone 6 met most of my expectations

    At first I wondered amazon doing merely impossible with this festival sales and I myself felt proud to get Iphone 6 at 16000 including 1000 amazon pay balance (with card offer included). I had some issues with phone signal all the time and I used to blame my network for it. phone used to get hang some times and I blamed the number of apps I use. Bluetooth reception is very weak: I got bose sound sport and even exchanged that saying bluetooth not working properly. But this signal problem daunted me soo much and I once contacted online service center who mailed me self help guides for checking my phone working condition and its completely fine. But one day I walked to a service center where in a glance they said my phone is having a screen which is a kind of first copy. I was completely speechless. Then i submitted my phone for signal issue and they said, they can't cover it in warranty and I need to change the mother board which is 22000. I told them the price at which i got it is 16000. Then I was lucky that discussion didn't went in a heated fashion and the manager over there was considerate and got it checked in first place. He said the piece is completely fake and in first place he believed me that I didn't fraud on him and sent the piece to apple service center, banglore. he also told me that its refurbished and its fault of seller. let the company take a decision and then we can claim from amazon based on the letter from company and original invoice.Luckily the piece was replaced with a brand new one. the signal reception is fantastic now, the phone is liquid smooth and now i can feel the apple brand value.Eventhough I could thank Appario Retail Private Limited that because of them I could get a new Iphone with improved battery life at no cost, I want to bring it to all your notice that these sales are a way to clear a lot of fault stock, returned items which do not perform well and a lot of copied products which you can't catch easily with naked eye. Seller Appario Retail Private Limited holds responsible in my case for sending me a fake copied product which only service center professionals could catch and not all service centers are same and they may think we are cheating and can even throw us out. Please be mindful of products you purchase and get it checked in service center if you are buying something at mindblowing price particulary during sales :P

    Key Features4.7-inch screenApple A8 processorUp to 128GB storageNFC (Apple Pay only)Touch ID fingerprint scannerPros Great 4.7-inch screen Good all-round camera Class-leading performance Great new software featuresCons Expensive Shorter battery life than rivalsiPhone 6: DesignThe iPhone 6 opts for soft curves and seamless joins between the screen and the back. It’s a very different look from the iPhone 5S, which has shiny machined edges. Barring some plastic detailing on the rear it’s all glass and metal, and looks great for it.It’s not as striking as its predecessor. The angular design of the iPhone 5S made it stand out amore. It’s the same with the iPad mini and iPad Air, although they marry the diamond cut edges with rounded metal sides.It may not be as instantly arresting, but the iPhone 6 looks like it’s been hewn from a single piece of metal and glass and fused seamlessly together. The effect is particularly strong in the space grey finish and with the screen turned off. It is a beautiful slab of black glass and anodised aluminium. We feel the design is safe rather than ground-breaking, though. The white bezel on the silver version ruins the seamless effect a little – we’d go for space grey every time.

    I know, \"iPhone is best this is what all iPhone users will say.But I am just posting my view on same.I got the phone little late than expected but it's okay. That's not a concern.Was really happy to received it, got initial needful work with any new phone in 15-20 mins.hich was pretty good.1st issue came after 2 days, I observed that battery of the phone is weak, As my wife is using I phone since 2.5 years I could easily differentiate.Though my usage was little higher than normal but battery never used to last for  more than 3 to 4 hours.2nd issue- may be a software bug, suddenly my hotspot used to stop working ( means for some times I could not create hotspot and that to when I needed to do it on priority.Not acceptable at all.3rd issue- on 11th or 12th day I don't remember exactly about which day but it got suddenly switched off and started after 10 mins without any reason. On next day, this happened again for 1 hour or so, I could see only apple logo on screen big reason to worry for me. When it started, battery drained to 12% from some 70% odd. And I could not charg it again.I got disappointed, may be I have got phone with hardware issues but certainly I had huge expectations from Apple.Discussed the same with Amazon, they asked job sheet from Authorised service centre which I got very easily as issue was genuine and easily got refund processed.Extremely satisfied with the service of Amazon and Especially apple authorised service centre.But disappointed with iPhone. Sorry iPhone users, but this is what it has happened. There were no lags in the phone except mentioned above, it was buttery smooth.Thanks for sparing time to read this.
